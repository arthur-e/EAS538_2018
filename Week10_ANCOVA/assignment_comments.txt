In exercise 4, the significance of each variable changed slightly, because the order in which those variables were entered into the aov function determines the ratio of their explained variance versus unexplained variance at that order. 

In exercise 5, both intercept and slopes should be country-dependent. 
The lab material is not entirely correct. Sorry about the misleading.
