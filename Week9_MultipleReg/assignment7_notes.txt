In question 3, the relative importance does not represent the R2 of that variable. It is the contribution of that variable to the R2 of the model. For example, 0.59 of temperature means the temperature accounts for 59% of the explanation power (or R2) of the model. 

"The beta coefficients change because the effect of each variable depends on the other variables that are also included in the model." This is not entirely correct. Whether the beta coefficient depends on the other variable can only be known if you have interaction term in your model.
